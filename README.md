# Web Services Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive project, **Clinic Management System**, developed during the Web Services course. The project showcases a range of concepts and techniques related to web service development, including RESTful APIs, data serialization, and integration with external services. It is designed to provide a robust foundation for understanding and implementing web service architectures.

## Project Core Functionalities

### REST API Development
- Implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing data.
- Provides structured endpoints for seamless interaction with clients.

### Data Management
- Supports both JSON and XML data formats for input and output.
- Ensures data persistence through database integration.

### External API Integration
- Demonstrates how to consume third-party APIs within the application.
- Integrates real-world services for enhanced functionality.

### Error Handling and Validation
- Includes robust error handling to manage edge cases and user errors gracefully.
- Validates data inputs to ensure consistency and reliability.

### Testing and Debugging
- Tested thoroughly using tools like Postman for endpoint validation.
- Includes logging mechanisms to track application performance and errors.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Framework**: Jakarta EE / Spring Boot (depending on specific modules)
- **Tools**: Postman for API testing, GlassFish server for deployment
- **Database**: SQL-based database for data storage and retrieval
- **Serialization Formats**: JSON and XML

## Database Contents
1. **Primary Data Tables**:
   - Stores core entities like users, products, or relevant domain objects.
2. **Logs**:
   - Maintains application logs for tracking interactions and debugging.

## Real-Life Applications
- **E-Commerce Platforms**: Provides backend services for managing products, orders, and users.
- **Educational Tools**: Implements APIs for handling student and course data.
- **Enterprise Systems**: Facilitates communication between distributed systems using web services.

## Design Highlights
- Follows the REST architecture to ensure scalability and modularity.
- Leverages data serialization for seamless communication between clients and servers.
- Implements security best practices, including authentication and authorization.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sajjan15/Web-Services.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and configure the database connection in the properties file.
3. Deploy the application on a GlassFish server or run it locally using your IDE.
4. Test endpoints using Postman or any preferred API testing tool.
